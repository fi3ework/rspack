# SolidJS

## How to Use

Rspack provides two solutions to support SolidJS:

- **Use Rsbuild**: Rsbuild provides out-of-the-box support for SolidJS, allowing you to quickly create a SolidJS project. See [Rsbuild - Solid](https://rsbuild.dev/guide/framework/solid) for details.
- **Manually configure Rspack**: You can refer to the current document to manually add configurations for SolidJS.

## Configure Solid

Thanks to the good compatibility of Rspack with the babel-loader, it is very easy to use SolidJS in Rspack. All you need is babel-loader and SolidJS babel preset. Rspack provides SolidJS [example](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/rspack-examples/tree/main/rspack/solid) for reference.

```js title="rspack.config.js"
/** @type {import('@rspack/cli').Configuration} */
const config = {
  context: __dirname,
  entry: {
    main: './src/index.jsx',
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.jsx$/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: 'babel-loader',
            options: {
              presets: ['solid'],
              plugins: ['solid-refresh/babel'],
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
  builtins: {
    html: [
      {
        template: './index.html',
      },
    ],
  },
};
module.exports = config;
```
